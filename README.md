## What I would do if I had more time
The main thing that got me during this exercise was how little I know about crypto and the blockchain. I would like to study more about blockchain and understand whats actually happening behind the scenes. This would allow me to finish the 2nd & 3rd steps, and fully understand "gas" and all of the concepts.

I also would clean up my front-end code and make separate components for each main element since the “App.tsx” file got quite large during this. The same goes for cleaning up some of the repeated code in the scss files, I would make the styles more reusable and not use the same code twice. 

And give the UI another round of polish (think through the UX more through Figma if I was re-doing this project with more time)
